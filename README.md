This repository if focused on [libOPC](https://libopc.codeplex.com) integration in macOS projects.

The [build.sh](https://github.com/aglv/OPC/blob/master/build.sh) script compiles libOPC as a macOS universal binary static framework. A recent version of the produced framework (release and debug versions) [is available](https://github.com/aglv/OPC/tree/master/build/frameworks) so we can use them in our projects by adding this repository as a submodule. 

The [doc.sh](https://github.com/aglv/OPC/blob/master/doc.sh) script generates the [libOPC API documentation](http://aglv.github.io/OPC/), hosted in this repository's github pages.

Please notice that I did not make libOPC: [credits go to the original authors](https://libopc.codeplex.com).
