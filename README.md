This repository contains a script that compiles [libOPC](https://libopc.codeplex.com) as an OS X universal binary static framework, along with the latest version of the produced frameworks (release and debug versions).

Please notice that I did not make libOPC: [credits go to the original authors](https://libopc.codeplex.com).
